The basic inventory API enables shared inventory behavior, including adding and removing equipment from the player's
inventory, and polling the inventory state (for example, for UI). The inventory handles networking of data itself. Only
one inventory per socket is supported. Note that when a player switches their active weapon, it will fire an unequip
event on the previously active weapon, then an equip event for the new active weapon.

Inventories expose the following functions, passed to RegisterBasicInventory in the follow table
{
    table GetInventory(player) [Client, Server]             Returns a table (below) describing the current inventory
    nil AddEquipment(player, equipment, setActive) [Server] Adds a new equipment to a player's inventory
    nil RemoveEquipment(player, equipment) [Server]         Removes an equipment from the player's inventory
}

An inventory is represented by an array (table with integer keys) of tables. Each table has the following elements:
{
    Equipment equipment                                 Equipment equipped in that spot
    bool isActive                                       Whether or not that equipment is currently active
}
