# FetchinFestivals
A game for the IGDA x Core Summer Jam. Game is based on the CORE game engine (currently in Alpha).

Game is super-duper pre-alpha (read: not really anything there yet), but the concept is to run fun 
fetch quests trying to convince two villages to hold a joint festival.

## How to Build/Install
* Download and install the Core game engine: https://www.coregames.com/
* Clone this repo into the `%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\CORE\Saved\Maps` folder on your computer
* Open Core and look for the game in the 'Create' tab
