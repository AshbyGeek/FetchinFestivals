# FetchinFestivals
A game for the IGDA x Core Summer Jam. Game is based on the CORE game engine (currently in Alpha).

Game is super-duper pre-alpha (read: not really anything there yet), but the concept is to run fun 
fetch quests trying to convince two villages to hold a joint festival.

## How to Build/Install
* Download and install the Core game engine: https://www.coregames.com/
* Clone this repo into the `c:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\CORE\Saved\Maps` folder on your computer.
* Open Core and look for the game in the 'Create' tab

## How to Clone the Repo (for git beginners)
* Download and install the github desktop app: https://desktop.github.com/
* Click the 'Clone or Download' button and then click the 'Open in Desktop' button in the dropdown. The browser may ask permission to open an external program.
* Choose the appropriate folder to clone the repo into. Since this project is a Core game engine creation it should always be `c:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\CORE\Saved\Maps`.
